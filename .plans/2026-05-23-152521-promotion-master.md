# Slopless promotion - master submission inventory

## Handoff for cold-start agents

**Read this first if you have no prior context.**

### What slopless is
Slopless is a deterministic textlint plugin + CLI that flags "AI slop" patterns in Markdown - the giveaway tells of LLM-generated prose (em-dash floods, weasel phrases, hedging, repetitive transition words, etc.). It is not an ML model; it is a rules engine that runs in CI or locally and either passes/fails the file or reports per-finding diagnostics.

- Repo: https://github.com/seochecks-ai/slopless (canonical; the `gh` CLI may redirect from `agent-quality-controls/slopless` - that's a rename, not a different repo)
- Local clone: `/Users/tartakovsky/Projects/agent-quality-controls/slopless/`
- License: MIT
- Stack: TypeScript, Node, published on npm as `slopless`
- npm: https://www.npmjs.com/package/slopless (current `0.2.12`)
- Stars/age: 351 stars, created 2026-05-16 (so it's roughly 1 week old when this plan was written on 2026-05-23)
- Topics: ai, cli, lint, linter, llm, markdown, nodejs, prose, quality, slop, static-analysis, style-guide, textlint, typescript, writing

### What this plan is
The goal is to promote slopless into every directory, registry, marketplace, awesome-list, and editorial outlet where its audience (engineers + technical writers who care about doc quality and detecting AI-written prose) will find it, doing as much as possible with automated agents rather than by hand.

This document is the **master prioritized inventory** of 80 verified targets, produced by 6 parallel research agents that each owned one category:

| Source file | Category covered |
|---|---|
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/awesome-lists.md` | GitHub `awesome-*` lists |
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/registries.md` | npm-adjacent indexers (Socket, Snyk, Libraries.io, deps.dev, OpenSSF Scorecard, badges) |
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/dev-tool-dirs.md` | Developer tool directories (AlternativeTo, StackShare, OpenAlternative, DevHunt, Sidebar.io) |
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/ai-tool-dirs.md` | AI tool directories (mostly rejected as wrong-audience SaaS funnels) |
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/marketplaces.md` | Package managers + integrations (GitHub Marketplace, pre-commit, Homebrew, VS Code, Open VSX, Nixpkgs, AUR, mise) |
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/editorial.md` | Newsletters, podcasts, OSS curation outlets, HN/Reddit/Show HN |
| `2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/2026-05-23-145502-slopless-directory-research.md` | The original research plan that dispatched the 6 agents - useful for understanding methodology and constraints |

Each source file has the verbatim CONTRIBUTING rules per target, exact submission paths, anti-automation flags, and per-target acceptance bars. When the master row says "see source file" or you need more detail, open the linked source file.

### How the work is split
- **Waves 1-2 = green, agent-executable.** PRs to repos, free form submissions, file commits. An agent can do these autonomously given a GitHub token and the row's submission instructions.
- **Wave 3 = yellow, human-mediated.** HN, Reddit, newsletter pitches, Product Hunt, podcast pitches. The agent **drafts** the post/email; a human posts from a real account because (a) the platforms ban bot posts and (b) anti-spam systems will shadowban or blacklist the project if we automate this. Drafts go into a `drafts/` subfolder under this plan when written.
- **Wave 4 = blocked.** Awesome lists with hard age/star gates that slopless has not yet cleared. These are scheduled, not skipped.
- **Wave 5 = auto-indexed.** Nothing to submit - just claim ownership where there's a claim flow, add badges to the README, and monitor for score changes.

### How to use this plan
1. If you're picking up Wave 1 work: read the row in the table, open the referenced source file for full CONTRIBUTING rules, draft the PR/submission, open it under the agent's GitHub identity.
2. If you're picking up Wave 2 work: the row says what artifact is missing (e.g., "needs `action.yml`"). Build the artifact first, ship a release, then submit. The "Artifact backlog" section at the bottom sequences these.
3. If you're picking up Wave 3 work: write the draft into `.plans/2026-05-23-152521-promotion-research/drafts/<venue-slug>.md` and notify the human to send/post it. Do not post yourself.
4. Always update this master file's status column when a target is submitted/accepted/rejected. The file is the source of truth for what's been done.

### Important constraints (mistakes the research agents already made - do not repeat)
- The canonical repo URL is `seochecks-ai/slopless`. The `ai-tool-dirs.md` agent claimed it was `agent-quality-controls/slopless`; that's a rename redirect and is wrong as a public URL.
- `caramelomartins/awesome-linters` and `BubuAnabelas/awesome-markdown` look attractive on paper but both have been stalled 12+ months. Do not submit. Rejected globally.
- Do NOT publish fake stars, sockpuppet reviews, or automated upvotes on HN/Reddit. GitHub strips fake stars and flags the repo; HN shadowbans the domain. There's prior research in the `kb` repo (`.plans/2026-05-18-darknet-github-star-market-landscape.md`) confirming detection is effective.
- Do NOT submit slopless to paid-only AI tool directories (TAAFT, Toolify, Futurepedia paid tier, TopApps.ai). Audience mismatch - dev CLI vs. SaaS-buyer audience - returns near-zero installs at high cost.
- Slopless's bundle is 11.2 MB raw / 3.1 MB gzip. Do not add a bundlephobia/packagephobia badge until that drops; the current size hurts.

### Highest-leverage non-directory work
The single biggest unlock for the whole inventory is shipping `npm publish --provenance` from a GitHub Actions workflow with `id-token: write`. It cascades into improved Socket, Snyk Advisor, and OpenSSF Scorecard scores simultaneously, and adds the visible "Provenance" panel on npmjs.com. Pair it with adding `.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`. Both are in the Artifact backlog as items 1-2.

## Summary
- Total verified targets: 71 (after dedup)
- Wave 1 - ship today, no blockers: 12
- Wave 2 - blocked by artifact work: 11
- Wave 3 - editorial pitches (human submits): 17
- Wave 4 - blocked by age/stars: 3
- Wave 5 - auto-indexed (claim/monitor): 12
- Rejected: 36

## Critical context
- Repo confirmed at `seochecks-ai/slopless`. `ai-tool-dirs.md` claimed `agent-quality-controls/slopless`; that is incorrect per `gh`.
- `npm publish --provenance` is missing - single highest-leverage fix; cascades into Socket, Snyk Advisor, OpenSSF Scorecard simultaneously.
- Bundle size 11.2 MB raw / 3.1 MB gzip - hold bundlephobia badge until reduced.
- Major source-file conflicts:
  - `caramelomartins/awesome-linters` flagged HIGH value in dev-tool-dirs and ai-tool-dirs, but last commit 2024-08-07 (21+ months). Awesome-lists agent correctly rejected as stalled. **Rejected globally.**
  - `BubuAnabelas/awesome-markdown` flagged HIGH in dev-tool-dirs, rejected as stalled (2024-08-21) in awesome-lists. **Rejected globally.**
  - `awesome-nodejs (sindresorhus)` appears as "wait then submit" in awesome-lists and "skip" in dev-tool-dirs. Reconciled to Wave 4 (blocked) with low acceptance odds noted.
  - `textlint wiki` appears in dev-tool-dirs, marketplaces, editorial (aggregators) - single deduped row.

## Artifact backlog (sequence work for Wave 2)

1. **`npm publish --provenance`** in release workflow (`id-token: write`, public `repository` field) - unlocks Socket/Snyk/Scorecard `Signed-Releases` + Provenance panel on npm.
2. **`.github/workflows/scorecard.yml`** (ossf/scorecard-action template, cron weekly) - unlocks OpenSSF Scorecard badge; cascades into deps.dev, Socket, Snyk scores.
3. **`action.yml`** composite action (in separate repo `seochecks-ai/slopless-action` to avoid workflow conflict) - unlocks GitHub Marketplace listing.
4. **`.pre-commit-hooks.yaml`** at repo root + tagged release - unlocks pre-commit discovery immediately; PR to `pre-commit/pre-commit.com sections/hooks.md` for listing.
5. **Homebrew formula** in tap `seochecks-ai/homebrew-slopless` first (zero review), then PR to homebrew-core.
6. **VSIX VS Code extension** (new repo, ~200-400 LOC TS, spawns CLI on `.md` save, parses JSON, pushes diagnostics) - publish to both VS Code Marketplace and Open VSX from one VSIX.
7. **Nixpkgs `package.nix`** (`buildNpmPackage`, ~25 LOC) - PR to nixpkgs.
8. **AUR `PKGBUILD` + `.SRCINFO`** - git push to AUR (no review).
9. **mise `registry/slopless.toml`** (5 lines) - PR to jdx/mise.
10. **README badge additions** (Scorecard, Socket, Snyk, packagephobia) - one PR after #1-2 ship.
11. **OpenSSF Best Practices registration** at bestpractices.dev - self-assessment.

Skipped artifact backlog:
- winget/Scoop Windows binary (audience mismatch)
- Snapcraft (audience mismatch)
- asdf plugin repo (mise covers it)
